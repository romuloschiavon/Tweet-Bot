# Tweet-Bot
Bot deleter criado para deletar meus tweets pessoais que jÃ¡ passaram de 1 ano.

## Set-up
First you'll need to set-up a developer project, you can google and do it. You will need the twitter API with full permissions to delete old tweets. 

Then you'll also need to download your personal data, if you want to set up a bot that deletes specific tweets (example: you can delete tweets with specifics words)

You can download your data in the Twitter desktop web/app going into Settings>Account>Data and downloading it.

Personal tweets will come in the tweet.js folder as an array of objects.

### Create a apikeys.py file

We need API Keys for this bot to work, so you can create your own apikeys.py file or you can change the main.py file and assign your API keys by hand.

### Pip

Probably you'll need to do: pip install tweepy
